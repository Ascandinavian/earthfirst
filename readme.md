# what's this?

Welcome to Earth First, an APE project to categorize everything wrong in the world, and pool together the few brain cells we have to come up with the best solutions.


Within this repository you will find many categories. As the repo is fairly new, categories may be moved around, split, or combined, but the general idea still remains: **_find a problem, find a solution_**.


You will notice that most of the repository (that's just a fancy word for "a buncha files together") is text-based. No need for wrinkly brains here, please feel free to fork and contribute.

_What makes it to this list?_

- interesting posts with lots of comments where discussion is geared towards solutions or problems
- links to good solutions
- links to explanations of problems


_Why not just link to the articles and videos instead of linking the reddit threads and articles?_

I believe that many wrinkle together make great brain, as a community our discussions are priceless. one ape may know something and post in comments and enlighten everyone else, and that bit of knowledge may change how we all see this problem or solution. Everyone has relevant info, this way you can browse the comments for more knowledge.

## I'm new to git and/or github, help!

There's a super cool tool called Gitkraken. it's how I learned how this system called "git" works, and they have a free tool with pretty buttons and graphs for you to use, that makes the process very intuitive!

To break it down to simple steps:

0. get code on your own machine (pull)
0. make changes
0. save changes in snapshot (commit)
0. push changes to the cloud (push)
0. _someone else make changes_
0. yoink those changes into your local machine (pull again)
